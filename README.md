# ChordJacobiDiagrams
 Yulia's dream research group's programming space dedicated to jacobi diagrams.

## "Chord_Jacobi_code"
In general, there is Vasiliev team's code that I didn't change. It could be optimized though. I think it could be written via numpy's functions and objects. When the right time comes with relevant need, I'll optimized a little bit.
To execute the code you have to install sympy:
```bash
pip3 install sympy
```

### vis.py
It's sort of visualization.
Need to install opencv:
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
```

### main.py
It's sort of test functions.

## "NAT_Toronto" and "Chord_Toronto"
It's a piece of work that I found at [there](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/papers/nat/natmath.html) and [there](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/papers/OnVassiliev).
There are mathematica modules that I don't know how to execute :)
